  A Ember modifier to trap your focus.

We use [focus-trap](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap) as a lower-level implementation.
It is super lightweight and has minimal dependencies.

Trap focus within a DOM node.

There may come a time when you find it important to trap focus within a DOM node â€” so that when a user hits `Tab` or `Shift+Tab` or clicks around, she can"t escape a certain cycle of focusable elements.

Please read the [focus-trap](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap) documentation to understand what a focus trap is, what happens when a focus trap is activated, and what happens when one is deactivated.
