# Acknowledgments

Thanks to [@davidtheclark](https://github.com/davidtheclark) for creating [focus-trap](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap).
This addon was only made possible by his work on the underlying library we use.

I acknowledgments that most of the examples and wording of this documentation
was inspired/copied from his work. In addition, I used his React component to
guide the implementation of the modifier.

Thanks to all the Ember folks as well for making modifiers possible.
